<p>Pennsylvania’s first authentic Hofbräuhaus – modeled after the legendary 400+ year-old Hofbräuhaus in Munich, Germany – is here! Guests are now able to enjoy many of the traditions from Germany that have made Hofbräuhaus famous. From the traditionally decorated rooms in the building to the beer that is brewed on-site, and of course the excellent German fare, Hofbräuhaus Pittsburgh is a memorable experience for all.</p>
